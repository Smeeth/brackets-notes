## Brackets Notes Extension

Extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) that allows the user to easily add and manage notes, with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) support.\*

\* This small extension was firstly developed for my personal projects' needs but I thought I should share for anyone that might find it useful.

**Tested with Brackets Sprint >=37**
